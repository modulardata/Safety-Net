<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>Your colleagues were working on another feature branch. However, they created some features that were not requested. They asked for your help to remove the changes they made. Help your friends by restoring a file to a previous state. Then, commit it with a nice message.</p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<p>Let's break this task into a few steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Switch to the <code class="java">feature/case</code> branch (create a local copy from the remote);</li>
<li>Restore the file <em>case_operations.py</em> from the <code class="java">6b2ec72</code> commit hash;</li>
<li>Commit the changes with a commit message <code class="java">refactor: restored case operations from 6b2ec72</code>;</li>
</ul>
