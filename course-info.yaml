summary: "<p>Git is a version control system that helps multiple developers collaborate\
  \ on a project. It tracks changes made to the project's files over time and allows\
  \ you to revert to a previous snapshot if something goes wrong. Git's branching\
  \ and merging capabilities help you work on new features or bug fixes, experiment\
  \ safely, and integrate changes smoothly. This project offers you a chance to work\
  \ and prepare your branches.</p><br/><br/>Learn more at <a href=\"https://hyperskill.org/projects/395?utm_source=ide&utm_medium=ide&utm_campaign=ide&utm_content=project-card\"\
