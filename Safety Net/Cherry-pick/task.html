<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>It's best to merge a feature branch to a development branch rather than the main branch. Don't worry; your task now is to fix this issue.</p>
<p>Switch to the development branch and cherry-pick the latest commit from the main. Reset the main to the original state before the last merge.</p>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-primary">When you reset the main branch, leave only the id <code class="java">d2d1138</code> commit should remain.</div>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<p>Let's break this task into a few steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Switch to the <code class="java">0.2.x-dev</code> branch;</li>
<li>Chery-pick last commit from the <code class="java">main</code> branch;</li>
<li>Switch to the <code class="java">main</code> branch again;</li>
<li>Reset <code class="java">main</code> branch to the state before the previous merge.</li>
</ul>
