<p>Let's start with a simple task. Clone the project repository from the remote and switch to the development branch.</p>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-warning">You may corrupt the repository while working on this project. As a precaution, it may be helpful to understand the status of the repository and branches before starting the objectives. The commands <code class="java">git branch --all</code> and <code class="java">git log --oneline</code> can help you.<br/>
If you want to start over, you can clone the repository again.</div>
